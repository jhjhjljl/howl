# Howl.css

Howl is a loyal, classless CSS framework that follows your HTML wherever it goes. Named after my Shih Tzu, it's designed to bark at the complexity of modern web dev—giving you a beautiful, semantic site using nothing but the tags you already know.

Howl styles the content, not the layout. Howl provides 100% semantic coverage for every [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements) tag. Howl does not touch broad containers like `<div>`, `<section>`, or `<main>` — layout is your business, the details are mine.

Howl is perfect for prototyping and honing your semantic HTML skills. However, please avoid using it in production, as classless CSS has inherent scaling limitations. It’s a great way to rediscover the power of native HTML elements.

Please download the `fonts` folder and ensure all fonts are linked correctly in the howl.css file, depending on where you saved it.
