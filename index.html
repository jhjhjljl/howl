			<h1>Text content</h1>

					<p>Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly—they’ll go through anything. You read and you’re pierced.</p>

			<section>
				<h2>&lt;b&gt;</h2>
				<p>Used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use &lt;b&gt; for styling text or granting importance. If you wish to create boldface text, you should use the CSS font-weight property. If you wish to indicate an element is of special importance, you should use the &lt;strong&gt; element.</p>

			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>&lt;kbd&gt;</h2>
				<p>Represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a &lt;kbd&gt; element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.</p>
				<p>Please press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to re-render an MDN page.</p>
